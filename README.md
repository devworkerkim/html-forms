# HTML Forms | The Odin Project

This is the repo for the HTML Forms project of the HTML And CSS course of The Odin Project.

## What I Learned

I feel like I'm getting faster at putting the HTML and CSS together.  This project involved recreating the account creation form page for Mint.com, which mainly includes a form with some input fields.  Much like the previous page recreations, I utilized flexbox to align my items and place elements in a structured manner.  The page itself is mostly text so there wasn't anything crazy that needed to be imported.  A few hours of time and I was able to put the HTML and CSS together.

### Dividing Form Elements

I decided it was best to lump each form field into its own `<div>` element.  I was having issues aligning the `<label>` elements to the left while keeping the `<input>` elements centered.  I ended up aligning everything in the `<div>` to the left but widening the `<input>` to the full width of the parent so it looked like it was centered.
